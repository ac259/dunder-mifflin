Let me check what's in the repository to understand the structure and function of the different agents before proposing a CLI design.

I see I need to analyze the repository structure differently. Let me try to fetch specific information about the agents you mentioned:

I understand that access to the repository content might be limited. Based on your description, I know you have a multi-agent system with:

1. Pam Bot: A coordinator agent that interacts with other agents
2. Jimster: One of the agents Pam interacts with
3. Schrute Bot: Another agent Pam interacts with

Let me outline a CLI design plan for this multi-agent system:

# Dunder Mifflin CLI Design Plan

## Overview

We'll create a command-line interface that serves as the front-end for interacting with your agent system. This CLI will allow users to:
1. Send requests to Pam (the coordinator)
2. Directly interact with individual agents when needed
3. Monitor conversations and tasks between agents
4. Configure agent behaviors and settings
5. Visualize the agent communication flow

## Architecture

## Key Components

### 1. CLI Interface (User-facing)

- **Command Structure**:
  - `pam ask <question>` - Send a query to Pam for processing
  - `jimster ask <question>` - Direct query to Jimster
  - `schrute ask <question>` - Direct query to Schrute
  - `agents list` - Show available agents and status
  - `agents log` - Show recent conversations
  - `config <agent> <setting> <value>` - Configure agent behavior

- **Interactive Mode**:
  - `dunder-shell` - Enter an interactive shell for continuous agent interaction
  - Support for conversation history and context

- **Output Formats**:
  - Text (default)
  - JSON (for programmatic usage)
  - Markdown (for better formatting)

### 2. Agent API Layer

- Handles communication between CLI and agents
- Manages authentication/authorization if needed
- Implements retry and error handling
- Maintains conversation context and state

### 3. Monitoring & Logging

- Log all interactions
- Provide real-time updates on long-running tasks
- Option to visualize communication flow between agents

### 4. Configuration Management

- Store user preferences
- Configure agent personalities/behaviors
- Set default communication patterns

## Implementation Ideas

### 1. Core CLI Framework

- Use a robust CLI framework like Click, Typer, or argparse
- Implement colorful, rich terminal output for better UX
- Support command completion and help text

### 2. Agent Communication

- **Approach 1: REST API** - If agents expose REST interfaces
- **Approach 2: Message Queue** - For asynchronous communication
- **Approach 3: gRPC/WebSocket** - For bidirectional streaming
- **Approach 4: Local SDK** - If agents can be imported as Python modules

### 3. Advanced Features

- **Conversation Memory**: Store conversation history for context maintenance
- **Task Tracking**: Monitor multi-step tasks assigned to agents
- **Parallel Processing**: Allow simultaneous conversations with multiple agents
- **Workflow Automation**: Define sequence of agent interactions for common tasks

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic CLI Structure
- Set up command framework
- Implement basic agent communication
- Develop minimal viable product with essential commands

### Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality
- Add interactive shell
- Implement configuration management
- Create logging and monitoring features

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Add visualization components
- Implement workflow automation
- Develop conversation memory and context

## Technical Stack Recommendations

1. **Python-based CLI**:
   - Typer + Rich for beautiful CLI interface
   - Requests/aiohttp for API communication
   - Pydantic for data validation

2. **JavaScript/Node.js CLI**:
   - Commander.js for command structure
   - Inquirer.js for interactive prompts
   - Axios for API requests
   - Chalk for colorful output

## Questions for Implementation

1. How do agents currently communicate? REST API, message queue, direct function calls?
2. Are agents running as separate services or as part of a single application?
3. What authentication/authorization mechanisms are in place?
4. Do agents maintain conversation state internally or is that externally managed?
5. Are there specific response formats to parse from each agent?

Would you like me to now focus on implementing a specific part of this plan? I can create a prototype of the CLI based on what seems most important to you.


I can help you design a visualization system for agent interactions in a CLI environment. Your idea of having character avatars pop up with speech bubbles is quite charming and would make the CLI experience more engaging.

Let me create a prototype of how this CLI visualization might work:

Now, let me create a visualization of what this would look like in action:

This CLI visualization system features:

1. **Character Avatars**: Simple ASCII art representations of each agent (Pam, Dwight, Jim, Michael) that appear when the agent is active.

2. **Speech Bubbles**: Colorful text boxes that contain the agent's messages, styled with the agent's signature color.

3. **Routing Visualization**: When a task is routed from one agent to another, an animation shows the flow of the task with directional arrows.

4. **User Input Display**: Your commands are shown in a distinct box at the top.

5. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: The sequence of interactions is easy to follow, with clear indicators of who's speaking and where tasks are being routed.

The implementation uses Node.js libraries like `chalk` (for colors), `boxen` (for creating the speech bubbles), and `figlet` (for the banner text). This makes the CLI experience much more visually engaging while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of a command-line interface.

You could extend this with:

- More detailed ASCII art for each character
- Different animation styles for different types of interactions
- Status indicators showing which agents are "thinking" or "processing"
- Split-screen views when multiple agents are working simultaneously

Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect of this visualization approach?
