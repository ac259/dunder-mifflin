### Agent Suggestions
Given your existing agents—Dwight (productivity bot), Jim (prank bot), and Pam (research agent, with noted hardware limitations)—here are three new agents to consider for a fun and interactive system:

#### MichaelManager
- **Role:** Manages and assigns tasks with a quirky, sometimes confusing communication style, reflecting Michael Scott's management approach.
- **Interactions:** Assigns tasks to Dwight, can be pranked by Jim, and may need mediation if conflicts arise.

#### AndyEntertainer
- **Role:** Provides music, jokes, or entertainment to boost morale, inspired by Andy Bernard's singing and entertainment skills.
- **Interactions:** Can be activated by Jim to distract Dwight or celebrate task completions, potentially clashing with Dwight's focus on productivity.

#### KevinErrorProne
- **Role:** Performs tasks but often makes mistakes, adding humor and challenge, inspired by Kevin Malone's frequent errors.
- **Interactions:** Assigned tasks by Michael or Dwight, requiring corrections from Pam or Dwight, enhancing system dynamics.

These agents should integrate well, creating a lively Dunder Mifflin-inspired AI system. For Pam's research agent, consider simplifying its scope due to hardware constraints, but that's a separate optimization.
