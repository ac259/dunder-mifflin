## Agent Interaction Architecture

## Implementation Strategy

Here's a step-by-step approach to building these agents:

### Phase 1: Core Framework Enhancement
1. Fix Pam Bot as your central coordinator
2. Implement Michael-Bot as the master controller
3. Enhance the existing Dwight and Jim bots

### Phase 2: Productivity Focus
1. Implement Angela-Bot for financial tracking
2. Create Oscar-Bot for research capabilities
3. Add Kevin-Bot for simplification tasks

### Phase 3: Wellbeing and Social
1. Build Stanley-Bot for work-life balance
2. Develop Toby-Bot for compliance
3. Implement Andy-Bot and Kelly-Bot for networking/social needs

## Technical Implementation

## Agent Integrations With Productivity Tools

To make these agents truly useful, they should integrate with your existing productivity tools:

1. **Calendar Integration**
   - Pam Bot can manage appointments and reminders
   - Stanley Bot can ensure work-life balance by blocking personal time
   - Andy Bot can prepare you for networking events

2. **Task Management**
   - Dwight Agent can enforce task completion and priorities
   - Angela Bot can track deadlines and send reminders
   - Michael Bot can provide motivation and progress updates

3. **Communication Platforms**
   - Kelly Bot can draft social media posts
   - Oscar Bot can fact-check before sending important communications
   - Toby Bot can review messages for compliance/appropriateness

4. **Document Management**
   - Kevin Bot can simplify complex documents
   - Angela Bot can organize financial records
   - Oscar Bot can research and add citations

## Agent Personas Implementation

To bring these agents to life with their distinct Office personalities, consider using:

1. **Character-Specific Language Models**
   - Fine-tune smaller models on character-specific dialogue
   - Create response templates with character phrases

2. **Voice and Visual Elements**
   - Use voice synthesis for audio responses in character
   - Add character avatars for visual representation

3. **Behavioral Triggers**
   - Program specific triggers that activate character-specific behaviors
   - For example, Kelly Bot activates excited mode when detecting exclamation points

## Next Steps

1. First focus on fixing Pam Bot as your central coordination system
2. Implement Michael Bot as the master controller of your productivity ecosystem
3. Create a common communication protocol for all agents to interact
4. Start with one new agent (suggest Angela Bot for finance tracking) to add immediate value
5. Develop a simple UI dashboard where all agents can report their activities
