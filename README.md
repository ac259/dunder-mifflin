# dunder-mifflin

Inspired by The Office, Dunder Mifflin AI is an agentic system designed to bring a mix of humor and efficiency to your everyday tasks. 
Whether it’s scheduling meetings (without double-booking like Michael Scott), managing emails (unlike Kevin’s famous chili disaster), or even delivering sarcastic but useful productivity insights à la Jim Halpert,
this AI assistant is here to help.

With a playful nod to Scranton’s most beloved paper company, this system doesn’t just get things done—it does them with the kind of quirky personality that makes work fun. 
Think of it as an AI Dwight Schrute: hyper-efficient, knowledgeable, and occasionally over-the-top, but ultimately making your life easier.
